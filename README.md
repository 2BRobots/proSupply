# proSupply

This is the ultimate power supply for your breadboard! It can give you a regulated 5v, 3.3v and 1.8v output from a USB port or charger.

What is it?

This is a power supply designed to be used in a breadboard for develop and test digital logic circuits. It has 5v, 3.3v and 1.8v outputs that makes it great for this purpose. It is powered via a micro usb connector so you can attach it your PC, phone charger or power bank. Also it has an external Vin pin, it is protected from inverse polarization, overvoltage and undervoltage. All the pins feature a overcurrent and overheating shutdown so you don't need to worry about burning your computer's USB port by a short circuit.

Why did you make it?

I make it to work with circuits in my breadboard on the go and without worry for a bad connection or overcurrent.

What makes it special?

It has a unregulated Vout pin, regulated 5v, 3.3v and 1.8v. Also it has an external Vin pin so you can power it without using the micro usb port. Regulated voltage can give up to 250ma per channel and the power supply can give up to 750ma in total before the protection circuit starts pulsing the output and the red led blinks indicating a fault condition. Also when using Vin pin the protector circuits shuts down everything is the voltage is to high in order to prevent damage, it does the same in undervoltage for prevent malfunction. This boards are manufactured by me using a DIY reflow oven, each purchase helps me to continue doing more projects and materializing ideas.

Everything is open source so you can check the schematics and eagle board files. Available in this repo.
